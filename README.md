## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I practiced Sass, its functions, how partials could be organized and BEM in this solution (class names can really be long but I never regreted using BEM) since it goes well with Sass, as well as building a page exactly by design. JavaScript determines device's width to decide if website should use a burger button menu or a regular menu, disables scrolling, appends a dark overlay behind the menu in its active state etc. 

Learned more about responsive typography and some newer CSS functions: 
```css
font-size: clamp(4rem, 2.3vw + 2.2rem, 5.3rem);
```
